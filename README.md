# Hey, I'm Danielle 👋
Software engineer in Cascadia 🌲 specializing in AWS serverless architecture and TypeScript. I focus on building reliable cloud infrastructure and backend systems, while helping teams ship effectively. Pragmatic about using whatever tools best solve the problem at hand.

By day, I'm a DevOps engineer at [Aspira](https://aspiraconnect.com/) building software for parks, camping, and RV management. Getting to combine my love of being outdoors with writing code that encourages others to get outside too? That's pretty great.
